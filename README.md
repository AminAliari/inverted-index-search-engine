This library provides efficient implementations of tree data structures such as Binary Search tree, AVL tree, TST tree, Balanced TST tree and Trie in addition to Hash table and other data structures only using array and array List. Additionally, we leveraged these data structures to index a dictionary passages and allow users to search, list and manipulate the data structures using a GUI interface.
